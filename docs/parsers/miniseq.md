## File Structure

The file structure for a miniseq run should be correct by default, but if you are having problems uploading, please verify your file structure is correct.

```

## Preparing your miniseq sample sheet
Before using the uploader, you must prepare your sequencing run with IRIDA-specific project IDs. You must do this manually after a run completes by editing `SampleSheet.csv` with Microsoft Excel or Windows Notepad.

Simply add the `Sample_Project` column to the `[Data]` header, and add the IRIDA project number.

An example, completed `SampleSheet.csv` with the `Sample_Project` column filled in looks like:

```
