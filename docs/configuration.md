## Configuration

To use the IRIDA uploader, you will need to create a client in IRIDA for the uploader.

Please refer to the ["Configure the Uploader" section on the IRIDA tutorials](https://irida.corefacility.ca/documentation/user/tutorials/uploader-tool/) for more information.

###File Location

You can create the config file yourself, or simply run the uploader for the first time to create a new config file with empty/default values.

You can find this file:

Linux: `~/.config/irida-uploader/config.conf`

Windows: `C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\irida-uploader\config.conf`

###Options

The config file has the following fields:

* `client_id` : The id from the IRIDA client you created
* `client_secret` : The secret from the IRIDA client you created
* `username` : The user that will be accessing projects/samples, this user needs the `Sequencer` or `Administrator` role. 
* `password` : Corresponding password for above user.
* `base_url` : The server URL is the location that the uploader should upload data to. If you navigate to your instance of IRIDA in your web browser, the URL (after youâ€™ve logged in) will often look like: `https://irida.corefacility.ca/irida/`. The URL you should enter into the Server URL field is that URL, with `api/` at the end. So in the case of `https://irida.corefacility.ca/irida/`, you should enter the URL `https://irida.corefacility.ca/irida/api/`
* `parser` : Pick the parser that matches the file structure of your sequence files. We currently support [miseq](parsers/miseq.md) and [directory](parsers/directory.md).


###Example
```
[Settings]
client_id = uploader
client_secret = ZK1z6H165y4IZF2ckqNQES315OyKQU8CsrpHNdQr16
username = admin
password = password1
base_url = http://localhost:8080/irida-latest/api/
parser = miseq
```
This can also be found in the file `example_config.conf`

## Specify other config file

Alternatively, you can pass a config file to the command line uploader as an optional argument.

Use `-c` or `--config` and specify the path to your config file.

Example:

```
# Linux
  $ ./irida-uploader.sh --config /path/to/config.conf /path/to/the/sequencing/run/

# Windows
  C:\Users\username> iridauploader --config \path\to\config.conf \path\to\my\samples\
```

### Linux:

Use the `irida-uploader.sh` script included with the source code to upload.
